<h2 align="center">Hello! I'm Prahaladh Chandrahasan!👋</h1>


Hi, I am Prahaladh, a founding engineer at [Circle-AI](https://www.usecircle.com/) where I am building AI agents for insurance. I am Engineering hire #2 for this company funded by Unusual Ventures and I am primarily responsible for the backend and infra of our product.

I recently graduated from the [School of Computer Science (SCS)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), CMU. I worked as a machine learning engineer at the Language Technologies Institute, CMU, advised by Prof. [Chenyan Xiong](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cx/) and Prof. [Mona Diab](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/faculty/diab-mona.html), where my primary role was to develop tools that aid in multimodal RAG and deep research agents research. I was also on the organizing committee of the NeurIPS competition: MMU-RAG: the Massive Multi-Modal User-Centric Retrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark ([Competition Website](https://agi-lti.github.io/MMU-RAGent/)) where my primary role involved the system design and implementation of the live evaluation platform along with developing mechanisms for participant registration and leaderboard calculation.

I was also a privacy engineer in the Software and Societal Systems department, CMU, where I worked under Professors [Norman Sadeh](https://www.normsadeh.org/), [Lorrie Cranor](https://lorrie.cranor.org/) and [Hana Habib](https://www.hanahabib.com/) on developing comprehensive case studies for applying the [UsersFirst](https://www.usersfirst.io/) framework. For my capstone project, I partnered with [Meta](https://www.meta.com/)'s AI Risk and Governance team to investigate user privacy expectations and develop solutions for enhancing transparency in AI voice assistants.

Before joining CMU, I worked as a Software Engineer at Bank of America in their APAC Payments team and also worked as a Software Engineer intern at the middleware engineering division of RedHat.
